<h1 class="title">About <span>Us</span></h1>


<p><h15 class="titlecontent">Jonathan Mumblow has been involved in motocross as a competitor for over 30 years.  Beginning as a rider in Massachusetts on a 1977 RM100 he raced New England Sports Committee races on a regular basis from 1979 through 1983, winning several events but, due to injury decided to pursue a different path. He decided to go to college, the later became an Air Force pilot, and now he is a commercial pilot.  During his years of schooling and work he decided to still race and ride every chance he could. In those years, he won several local vet championships.  Jonathan recently decided to discontinue riding himself and give back to the sport that has always been his passion.  He launched his own race team looking for young talented riders to help them achieve their goals in the sport of motocross.</h15></p>
<p><h15 class="titlecontent">The team is a family business, with his wife Angela as team manager; daughters Marissa and Monica serve as trainers and race support.</h15></p>
<p><h15 class="titlecontent">Jonathan and his team are determined to build a race team on faith, sportsmanship, character and professionalism. While at the same time offer cost effective advertising and marketing programs for sponsors.</h15></p>
<br>

<p><h15 class="titlecontent">Our ultimate goal is "Winning at the national level as a team and a family".</h15></p>
<br>

<p><h15 class="titlecontent">Respectfully,</h15></p>
